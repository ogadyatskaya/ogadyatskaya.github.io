        		<h1>Olga Gadyatskaya</h1>
				<p>Hi there!</p>
				<p>I am Assistant Professor of Cyber Security at LIACS, Leiden University.</p> 
				<p>I work on a variety of topics pertaining to cyber security of organizations, ranging from security risk management and threat modeling to mobile security and secure software development. My main goal is to make organisations more secure by improving their security management practices, helping them to secure their software and systems, providing them insights into cyber threats, and assisting them in making decisions about cyber security. </p>

				<p>I lead the <em>Leiden Organizational Cyber Security</em> (LOCS) group at LIACS. Find out more about our group <a href="https://locs.liacs.nl/">https://locs.liacs.nl/</a></p>

				<p>I teach courses on cyber security in several MSc and BSc programmes at Leiden University. I also supervise MSc and BSc projects. Please contact me via email if you would like to work on a cyber security-related thesis project under my supervision.  </p>
